            In scaratch I created a short animation of a dog eating a birthday cake. 
            
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%204/Save%20the%20Princess%20-%20Play%20Lab.html"></a></p>
            I used Play Lab to create a simple game entitled "Save the Princess". Youre a knight you needs to avoid hazardous fireballs and reach the princess before its too late. 
            
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%204/Music%20simulator%20App%20-%20App%20Lab.html"></a></p>
            I used App Lab to create an app that simulates different musical instraments.
        
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%205/Alice%20Project.a3p"></a></p>
            I used Alice to create a game simulating a car chase. The objective was to not get caught by the two cars chasing you. 
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%206/First%20Page.html"></a></p>
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%206/Second%20Page.html"></a></p>
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%206/Third%20Page.html"></a></p>
            These are the three pages to the first website I created using HTML. It had a list of my favorite websites, resteraunts, some photos, and even a contact page. 
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/week%208/Math%20Game%20code.txt"></a></p>
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/week%208/Contact%20Us%20page%20code.txt"></a></p>
            In this week I created another contact us page similar to a couple of weeks before. I also created a math game that showed the number of correct and incorrected answers and gave a percent.
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%209/First%20p5.js%20Page.html"></a></p>
            This was my first experience with p5.js, and I created a self portrait. Thankfully it was not very accurate. 
        
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%2010/Week%2010.html"></a></p>
            In this week I learned how to move simple shapes around using p5.js, I was able to add some movement to my self portrait this way. 
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%2011/sketch.js"></a></p>
            This week we added loops, variables, and event based movement to our p5.js page. 
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%2012/sketch.js"></a></p>
            This week we included functions in our p5.js page 
       
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/Jacob-Irvin/MART-120/blob/master/Week%2013/Week%2013.html"></a></p>
            This was the final week of projects and we added arrays into our previous p5.js page from the week before.
